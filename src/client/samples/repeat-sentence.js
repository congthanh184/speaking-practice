  'Good morning, welcome to Rosewood Hotel. My name is Chris, how may I help you?',
  'Most of our top floors are fully booked, but we have some double rooms available on the third and fourth floor. Would that be fine with you?',
  'Let me check. Yes, we have a room that meets all your preferences, with an East facing balcony, so you will get to enjoy the sunrise view every morning. How many nights do you plan to stay?',
  'The room costs one hundred and ninety dollars per night for two people, but we are running a spring season promotion, so it comes down to one hundred and seventy dollars. If you sign up to be our member, you get to enjoy a further discount of 5%.',
  'The room cost doesn’t include meals, but our restaurant offers buffet breakfasts and dinners at a discounted price for guests who stay at the hotel.',
  'That tram only goes to the city. It usually takes thirty minutes to go to the nearest airport by car, but I suggest you allow more time than that, just to be on the safe side. A train station in the area is currently under construction, so there are road closures at certain times of the day.',
  'Good morning, you must be Ms. Lai. Nice to meet you. I am the consultant on duty here, and I will answer any questions you may have.',
  'Don’t worry about that, our next client has just cancelled his appointment, so you have ample time. So, I assume you have some queries about your retirement plans.',
  'For many people, retirement is no longer a time to be confined to a boring, unproductive life. There are plenty of amazing things you can do.',
  'If you are still healthy and active, retirement is the perfect time to get more involved in the community. Have you considered volunteering, or taking up a new hobby?',
  'That is an excellent idea. Have you put in the time to assess your financial position yet? This is to make sure you will be able to live comfortably after you stop working.',
  'I’d recommend calling your super fund directly to get the latest update of your account balance. By the way, do you know you may also be eligible for the Age Pension?',
  'Ms. Hoang, please sit down. According to an anonymous report that we’ve received, you have overstayed your 6-month tourist visa. What do you say about this?',
  'That attitude does not work in your favour, Ms. Hoang. We have evidence to support these claims. Are you aware that you have broken the law?',
  'Well, before your visa was granted, you signed a document, which clearly stated all your obligations. This means you were fully aware of them.',
  'Deliberately or not, you have turned a blind eye to something very important. We also have proofs that you have been working illegally here. Do you have anything to explain?',
  'I can sympathise with your situation. But even when you hit rock bottom, violating the laws is not the right way to go.',
  'As much as I want to help you, there is little I can do. You will need to attend a hearing at the Migration Review Tribunal next Monday, then wait for their decision.',
  'Good morning, thanks for being here on time. So, your cousin Stephanie referred you to us, am I right? How may I be of assistance?',
  'That area is always in high demand. Could you tell me more about your property? Do you have some photos that I can take a look at?',
  'That’s great. Your house appears to be within walking distance to Bankstown shopping centre as well. I have some buyers seeking a property in this area.',
  'If you are committed to making an immediate sale, I recommend that you sell your property by auction. Have you heard about this before?',
  'You will provide the reserve price, which is the minimum price you will accept. If the home doesn’t reach your reserve price, you can enter further negotiations with the current highest bidder.',
  'That’s fine. But you should organise the evaluation for your property immediately as it is a prerequisite for the sale. How about this weekend?',
  'I am afraid that will have to wait until next week because this weekend I will be in Melbourne for my niece’s full month party.'
